# Koskinen, I., Zimmerman, J., Binder, T., RedstrÃ¶m, J., & Wensveen, S. 2011. Design research through practice: From lab, field, and showroom. San Francisco, CA: Morgan Kaufmann.
- Communicating the work / research through an [[exhibition]] rather than papers or a product
- More and more collaborative work, that needs flexibility in the methods and theory used

## Chapter: How Constructive Design Research Produces Meaning
- Research is today more based on [[imagination]] and [[speculation]]. It is not only building and altering reality, it is adding more depth to it by showing/offering more alternatives of [[Reality]], of what could be.
- Act of invention that adds to reality
- Hypothetical [[Design|designs]] can change the way people think, about [[Material]] and [[Society|social]] [[Reality]]
- Provide new ways of thinking and perspectives, as many ways of thinking are internalised and unflexible > [[Disruption]]
- Opens up more possibilities and prepare [[action]], enables new ways of seeing and discussing opportunities
- Provides examples and precedents, that you can reach back to if such situation may occur in the [[Future]] > may ==prepare for what is to come==

- [[Dunne&Raby]],[[Critical Design]]: Design that asks crafted questions and makes us think, opposed to design that solves or finds answers
	- Difference to art: Dunne Raby argue that art is too removed from the world (of consumption) to be effective
	- Purpose is to stimulate discussion and debate among audience, designers, industry and public. Opposed to other 'visions' that try to set trends or propagate and envision the future
	- It is ==not about re-imagining a better future, but about disrupting the existing one==

## Chapter: Toward Socially Robust Knowledge
- What does knowledge do to [[Society]]? > Interesting question, since researcher have been more concerned about making discoveries and researching than to think of what impact this knowledge would have on society
- Thus, research has to be closely linked with society
- In discourse with the public
- Interprets society rather than be the 'legislater', the one who 'decides'

## Project: Reframing Public Health in a Favela
- [[Cultural Probes]]: cameras, letters, diaries, tasks for volunteer workers, workshops so people understood the cultural probes and their results
- Instead of improving sanitation (which is too big a task), they improved [[awareness]] about hygiene
	- Project reflected the world the people lived in, rather than abstract instutitions
	- Low tech design was used: comics, etc (more understandable than computer systems)
- **Effectiveness**: Design was [[Evaluation|evaluated]] in workshops (if and how they understand it), design/workshop was ==recreated somewhere else to see its scalability==
	- How does the design, when introduced to people's life, shape their activities, thoughts, and interactions?
- Design project created [[knowledge]] about the village, the visible and [[Material]] culture, habits, beliefs, social structures [[knowledge]]

## Chapter: Understanding as the Basis of Design
- [[ethnography]] : Understanding as a tool.
- Example: When computers moved from industry to the home, design research and ethnography was necessary to understand how people use these new tools and ==what they wanted from it. ==
- [[Field research]]: Being with the people to find out what they do rather then what they say
- Observations not only to make better design, but to inspire and inform own work in subtle ways ([[Wang Chau]]!)
- More than tourism:
	- About understanding people's mind
	- Gathering of data
	- Developing empathy (emphatic grasp)
	- Most important: ==Driven by understanding rather than data==

## Chapter: Exploring Context with Props
- [[Field research]]: Focus on products, things, prototypes, mock-ups
- Workshop: Designers used [[toolkit]] with legos, pens,...
- Participants used those tools to create artefacts that embody their feelings, values and perspectives
- Exercise of imagination rather than collecting data
- Stimulating people's [[imagination]] and [[dream|dreams]] > hard to see people's dream, so those exercises help
- ==Kits for Dreaming!==
- How to synthesis ideas from the field work?

## Chapter: Co-Design and New Objects [[co-creation]]
- Designer is here the facilitators, who encourages people to take part in design process
- Exploration together with the people > should be reflected/visible in process
- [[action research]]: trying to understand people, what they need, want and worry about and turning this [[knowledge]] into [[action]] that changes the [[community]]

[[zhdk]], [[Sweet dreams are made of this]]

# John Thackara. 2006. In the Bubble: Designing in a Complex World. MIT Press. Excerpt.
- Design has wide reaching implications, as many products and services are influenced by design decisions
- [[Design politics|Design decisions]] / Design is politics: Influences use of material, shape, process, energy, how they are operated and also what to do when the product is no longer needed
- Herb Simon: Everyone designs if they take actions aiming at changing the existing state into a [[Future|preferable]] one
- Papanek: Design is a human activity, any action towards a desirable goal
- [[Technology]] dominates [[Society]], it tries to answer everything. It has become overwhelming, become unclear what it is the answer to, what value it adds to our lives.
- Thackara describes technology as almost pollution, as there is too much without clear intent.
- People were put under technological advancement that destroyed [[traditions]], [[cultures]] and ([[indigenous]]) wisdoms (as they are seen as backwards)
- Biotech is criticised for being super optimistic while delivering no concrete results (so is to a certain degree [[Biodesign]])
- Need change focus back to people, before tech. Thackara calls it designing people back into situations. ==Priority to human agency.==
- Technological and [[Politics|political]] advancement supposed to be for the good of people, but most of the time, people are marginalised and only a small group benefits
- Shift from products/things to events that gather and benefit more people, like [[workshops]] and design activities
- Even small design decisions have big impacts, as like politics it influences everything in everyday life
- Design mindfulness: being sensitive to context, relationship and consequence when designing

- [[Design service|Service]] not things
- Create social alternatives
- Be in the bubble but also outside of it, gain perspective

# Lilly Irany. 2015. 'Justice for Data Janitors' in PublicBooks.org
- Technology often promises new work and wealth, but often it takes away jobs and outsources tasks to cheap human labour, making wealthy only those who own the tech/[[Machine|machines]].
- "[[Automation]] doesn't replace labour, it displaces it"
- Making [[AI]] work, a lot of human labour is necessary, as the machine only learns what it has been told
- Invention of washing machine raised standard of cleanliness, so domestic workers had to work (clean) even harder
- =="Computers were women"==, reference at the work women used to do (calculating in offices)
- Amazon Mechanical Turk: how a lot of automation still works today. A computer generates a script and a worker has to execute it (example Amazon Warehouse). Like this, the worker has no room for creative problem solving or any [[agency]] and is just doing what the machine tells him
- One directional way of command is unflexible, as there is no [[Feedback loop]], no exchange of experience between worker and manager.
- Automation is not the problem but the relationship it creates.
- There is no place for humans / human factor, so machines have a big impact in the social ecology
- It's all the dirty work, just without having the workers (in your countrry)
- One solution Iran proposes is an income guarantee, so workers don't have to accept jobconditions like these

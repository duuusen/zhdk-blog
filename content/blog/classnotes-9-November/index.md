- As designers, we are already in a position of privileged, biased. Can we design beyond that? Can we overcome that?
- Literature review: What am I really looking for?
- Quickly identify what is useful and what not > classified approach, playful approach to literature research
- We are designers, but then really makers in general, essentially
- Going back and forth: writing > prototyping > making > writing
- experimenting > creation of meaning (making sense paper)
- What does it mean to create something?
- Production of meaning is what we write about when we do our thesis
- Clear research questions, and what are the methods to engage them?
- How to share the results so they can be replicated?
- What is the thing I want to achieve?
- As soon as you have a hypothesis is to try it out, instead of working forever on the idea and never testing it
- Not getting lost in storytelling
- What is my arch? > Narrative going on, projecting yourself into the arch
- Changing locations



During all my interest, what would be really cool question to answer in my thesis?
- Addressing neocolonial power structures
- Where to start?
- Do people really want? > going to
- colonial logic internalised > many profit

- Is there really an interest in decolonial healing? Since so much seems internalised and so many actually profit from it?

- Can I create beyond that? How can I as a "Westerner" convincingly sell it?

- Is there really neocolonial behaviour? And to the people really want to get rid of it?
> Concern that I am voicing could be the research, it is the work, the thing I try to find out.
> What does it mean to go to another country and help those people?
> Or whole work is about denouncing white designer saviour problem?
> Hightlight people who are already doing what they already do on the ground, that work that is now visible

I have misunderstood the call to dream with a call to just chilling and being lazy that week. Not that I have been lazy, au contraire I have been too busy that even if I wanted to dream, there was no time for it. The weeks are now so packed with assignments and side projects that I would need another retreat to have the mindspace I would need to dream.
First and foremost, I want to have fun. If I end up as a UX minion or opening a restaurant in the jungle like David Saiia or end up having my own studio doesn't matter as long as I don't have fun. I dream to travel as part of what I'm doing, visiting many cultures and places, as I draw my inspiration from that. I actually do dream of a small studio with friends and collaborators and doing just this: Collaborating with people on projects, whatever those may be, because I enjoy it. And hopefully, through having as much fun as I can have, I can contribute back by what I am doing and through (if I'm gifted to do so) teaching.

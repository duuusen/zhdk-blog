## What is global history? Analysis of commodity chains
- Not about covering entire globe, but aware of importance of global correlation.
- Showing connection
- Aware of global comparisons and influences
- Explain why other things might not be connected

- When history became academic discipline \> by end of 19th century, every uni would have history department
- When that happened, nationalism emerged \> belgium became nation, germany, switzerland \> many nations were born and were in search of a biography \> defining own history and looking at others as alien
- **Institutionalism of history is tied to nationalism**
- Result: Europe became default (center of world), industrialisation as western
- In 1990 globalisation affected all societes \> need of global history \> history that looks for connections and not only looks for certain countries
- Wallerstein, Historical capitalism \> theory that linked the world together
 - Core \> Periphery (cheap labour) \> Semi-Periphery (Wallerstein World System Theory Model) \> Macro-model, looks at whole continents, does not look at how people on the ground actually felt

- Commodity Chain \> Coffee consumption looks different in Palestine and Vienna \> taking commodity as red thread of global history \> follow your product and try to make sense of global correlations

- Cotton most prominent commodity \> important of technological innovation, ubiquitous

## South Asia, Atlantic World and Emergence of Cotton as Global Commodity
- Global center of production becomes clear \> First in south then also in north India \> Production, weaving, dying
- Why? Geographical position, productive agricultural system, quality of cloth, biggest market well into 19th century
- Trade: Sean and land, space of exchange and socio-cultural communication, no core-periphery or regions, Europe enters system from 16th century with trading companies \> well balanced situations without trade wars and political aggression \> 'soft globalisation'
- Indian textile \> no de-industrialisation of local textile manufacturing but stimulation for development technique
- Indian product became benchmark for quality and design \> assimilation of Indian aesthetic, influencing clothing taste

- Implications for Europe \> Founding's of trading companies (East India Company etc) \> What motivated the Portuguese (spices) is now cotton, because there is more money to get than with spices

- Europe catching up \> Northern Italy and Southern Germany, Belgium, Northern France, England \> not on same level as India

- Slave trade was funded with cotton \> 80% was slaves for cotton \> **cotton was the heart of slave trading**
- Only sugar was more lucrative than cotton \> sugar was cultivated in the Carribbean and based on slave labour \> only slaves from Africa proved resilient to Carribean and South American climate
- Europe \> growing it's own cotton

- 1000 - 1500: Local linkages, no global web of cotton
- 1500 - 1780: No stark hierarchies
- 1780: European entering the system changed it massively, dominating entire trade
	- Naval power, colonialism, seizure of land, slave labour, invention of spinning machines

- Ecological consequence of cotton and sugar monoculture \> Indians did not plant monocultures, cotton was planted alongside vegetables and other plants
- America takes prominent position

## Fibre of Fortune and Political Symbol: Cottin in 19th and 20th Century

- 1840: Explosion in cotton trade and production from America, cotton web has been rearranged, India has lost its importance \> from producer to consumer
- Garments from UK can be sold cheaper than Indian garments
- Cottonquality from America was better and more suited more industrial production (for hand-weaving the quality did not play such an important role)
- Deindustrialisation



- North felt the supremacy of the South, humanitarian reasons came up in the North
- Liberation of 4 million slaves from South
- New centers, Mulhouse
- Cotton famine
- Intensification of imperial control over potential cotton-growing in Africa and Asia

- 1863: Cotton import from southern states fall by 96%
	- Severe losses
	- Worker riots
	- Scramble for new supplies

- War about cotton
	- Who would grow cotton when not slaves?
	- Role of states in securing cotton
	- Role the US plays in the new cotton world
	> - Need of national solutions, 'America First'

- North and South in war \> going back to India
- India enters global system again and becomes a global player of cotton by 1862
- Center of Mumbai: Money to burn
